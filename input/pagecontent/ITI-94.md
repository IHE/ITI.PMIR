#### 2:3.94.4.1 Subscribe to Patient Updates Request Message

The Subscribe to Patient Updates message is a FHIR create operation on a
*Subscription* Resource.

##### 2:3.94.4.1.1 Trigger Events

A Patient Identity Subscriber triggers a Subscribe to Patient Updates
Request to a Patient Identity Registry according to the business rules
in its system. These business rules are outside the scope of this
transaction.

##### 2:3.94.4.1.2 Message Semantics

A Patient Subscriber initiates a FHIR create request using HTTP POST as
defined at [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#create](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#create) on a
Subscription Resource as defined at
[https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/subscription.html](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/subscription.html).

A Patient Identity Registry shall support accepting a request for both
the JSON and the XML messaging formats as defined in FHIR. A Patient
Subscriber shall send either the JSON or the XML messaging formats as
defined in FHIR. See [ITI TF-2: Appendix Z.6](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.6-populating-the-expected-response-format) for more details.

See [ITI TF-2: Appendix W](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-W.html) for informative implementation material for
this transaction.

###### 2:3.94.4.1.2.1 FHIR Subscription Resource Constraints

A Patient Identity Subscriber shall create a Subscription Resource. The
Subscription Resource shall be further constrained as described in the 
[Subscription Profile for PMIR](StructureDefinition-IHE.PMIR.Subscription.Request.html).


# 2:3.94.4.1.2.1.1 Criteria Constraints

The values for criteria enable Consumers to limit results based on what
Patients they are concerned with.

The Patient Identity Subscriber shall support the ability to subscribe
to the [Mobile Patient Identity Feed \[ITI-93\]](ITI-93.html) with at least one
criteria. The Patient Identity Registry shall support processing
subscriptions with all criteria. The criteria list includes:

  - `Patient` – to subscribe to all Patient updates

  - `Patient?_id=X` – to subscribe to updates for a single Patient where
    X is the id of the Patient Resource

  - `Patient?organization=X` – to subscribe to updates for Patients
    related to a single Organization

  - `Patient?identifier=X` – to subscribe to updates for Patients based on
    their identifier. Since X is a token parameter type, a subscriber
    may limit by system, value, or both. See
    [http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#token](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#token).

##### 2:3.94.4.1.3 Expected Actions

A Patient Identity Registry shall accept the request, and return an HTTP
201 response when the Subscription is created or an error code with an
OperationOutcome if an error occurs as per
[https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#create](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#create).

A Patient Identity Registry shall store the Subscription Resource and
manage the subscription to enable the [Mobile Patient Identity Feed
\[ITI-93\]](ITI-93.html). How it creates and manages the subscription is not specified
by IHE. When the subscription has been activated, the Subscription
Resource status shall be changed to `active`.

If an error occurs at any time with an active subscription, the Patient
Identity Registry shall update the Subscription Resource and set the
status to `error` and the error element with the error message. The
Patient Identity Subscriber may use the Get Patient Subscription Request
to get the current status of the Subscription. See Section 2:3.94.4.3.

#### 2:3.94.4.2 Subscribe to Patient Updates Response

##### 2:3.94.4.2.1 Trigger Events

A Patient Identity Registry sends the Subscribe to Patient Updates
Response to the Patient Subscriber when the subscription request is
received.

##### 2:3.94.4.2.2 Message Semantics

A Patient Identity Registry responds to the Subscribe to Patient Updates
Request with an HTTP Status of 201 with the Location header set to the
created Subscription Resource or an error as defined at
[https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#create](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#create).

##### 2:3.94.4.2.3 Expected Actions

A Patient Identity Subscriber has received the response and continues
with its workflow. It may maintain the returned id if the Subscription
Resource needs to be queried, disabled, or deleted later.

#### 2:3.94.4.3 Get Patient Subscription Request/Response Message

A Patient Identity Subscriber can retrieve from the Patient Identity
Registry the current details of a subscription by accessing the Location
returned by the Subscribe to Patient Updates Response as defined at
<https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#read> on the Subscription Resource.

A Patient Identity Registry shall return the current Subscription
Resource.

#### 2:3.94.4.4 Enable/Disable Patient Subscription Request/Response Message

A Patient Identity Subscriber can enable or disable a subscription on
the Patient Identity Registry by accessing the Location returned by the
Subscribe to Patient Updates Response as defined at
<https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#update> on the Subscription
Resource. This can be used to temporarily disable the subscription by
changing the status to `off` or re-enable a subscription by changing the
status to `requested`.

A Patient Identity Registry shall disable a subscription when the status
is `off`.

The Patient Identity Registry shall handle changes with a status of
`requested` as per Section 2:3.94.4.1.3.

#### 2:3.94.4.5 Delete Patient Subscription Request/Response Message

A Patient Identity Subscriber can delete a subscription from the Patient
Identity Registry by accessing the Location returned by the Subscribe to
Patient Updates Response as defined at
<https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#delete> on the Subscription
Resource.

A Patient Identity Registry shall stop sending the Mobile Patient
Identity Feed to the *Patient Identity Consumer endpoint defined in the
Subscription.channel*.

### 2:3.94.5 Security Considerations

See [ITI TF-1: 49.5](volume-1.html#1495-pmir-security-considerations) for security considerations for the PMIR Profile.

See [ITI TF-2: Appendix Z.8](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.8-mobile-security-considerations) for common mobile security considerations.

The subscription is made by the Patient Subscriber, which must be
authorized at the Patient Identity Registry to request subscriptions.
This authorization is valid at the time the Subscribe to Patient Update
transaction request/response. The timeout associated with the client
authorization does not impact the life of the subscription. However, the
Patient Subscriber identity has no impact on the resulting Mobile
Patient Identity Feed endpoint authentication or authorization. There is
no communication of security credentials for the Mobile Patient Identity
Feed transaction within the Subscribe to Patient Update transactions.

#### 2:3.94.5.1 Security Audit Considerations

The Subscribe to Patient Updates transaction is a REST Information event
as defined in [ITI TF-2: 3.20.4.1.1.1-1](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ITI-20.html#3.20.4.1.1.1).

Note that the same audit message is recorded by both Patient Identity
Subscriber and Patient Identity Registry, the difference being the Audit
Source element. Both actors audit this transaction to show consistency
between the request by the Patient Identity Subscriber and the action
taken by the Patient Identity Registry.

The actors involved shall record audit events according to the
[Audit Event for Subscribe to Patient Updates Transaction by the Patient Identity Subscriber and Registry](StructureDefinition-IHE.PMIR.Feed.Audit.Subscription.html).
